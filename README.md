Hi! My name is Tifany, and I currently live in Brazil. I currently work as a Software Engineer. I am always looking to improve my skills through studies, practice, and research. I feel comfortable designing my own layouts and applying them in practice during development. This year, I plan to work on more open-source projects to contribute to the community and refactor all my old projects using the new practices I have been learning to enhance my portfolio.
